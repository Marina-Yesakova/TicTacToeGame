# TicTacToeGame
A program that allows two players to play a game of tic-tac-toe on 4x4 board.

Game user interface description:

1. Two players are playing a game, taking turns to make a move. Player 1 places Xs, and player 2 places Os on the 4x4 board. 
Player 1 wins when there are three Xs in a row on the game board (player 2 wins when there are three Os). 
Three Xs (or Os) can appear in a row, in a column, or diagonally across the board. 
A tie occurs when all of the locations on the board are full, but there is no winner.

2.On each turn the board is being displayed
1 2 3 4

d e f g
When the user wants to make a move, he/she chooses a number (kind of a Hex system), that represents the placement of X or O on the board.
